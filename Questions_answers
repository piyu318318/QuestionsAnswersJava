1)Can we overload static methods? 
ans : The answer is ‘Yes’. We can have two or more static methods with the same name, but differences in input parameters. For example, consider the following Java program.
// filename Test.java
public class Test {
    public static void foo() {
        System.out.println("Test.foo() called ");
    }
    public static void foo(int a) {
        System.out.println("Test.foo(int) called ");
    }
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Test.foo();
        Test.foo(10);
    }
}


2)CAn we override Static methods ?
ans: Static methods are bonded at compile time using static binding. Therefore, we cannot override static methods in Java
